This video and what Hunar Ahmad did has haunted me for a few months so I wanted to try it myself.

This project was inspired by: Jeffery Ventrella's Clusters http://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/ I don't have access to Ventrella's code but I guess the main difference of my project with the other particle life projects is that I didn't implement collision detection and this has simplified the simulation. Also, I added GUI controls to change the parameters in real-time. This allows easy fine-tuning & exploration, hence, I was able to find some never-seen-before patterns emerge form some extremely simple models of relations. 
The code here is probably an order of magnitude simpler than any other Artificial Life codes out there because I started this solely as an educational material for non-programmers and the general audience.
