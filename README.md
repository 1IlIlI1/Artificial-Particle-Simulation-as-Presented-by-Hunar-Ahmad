## This video and what Hunar Ahmad did has haunted me for a few months so I wanted to try it myself.<br>
##I'ma total suck noob at coding (like I had to google how to do a break<br> facepalm. I know a smidge of C++ in that I don't know C++ but kinda can read the syntax but have to google tons of crap.  I know no JavaScript.  But I really wanna learn.  It seems like magic and there is no such thing as magic except doing.

This project was inspired by: Jeffery Ventrella's Clusters http://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/ I don't have access to Ventrella's code but I guess the main difference of my project with the other particle life projects is that I didn't implement collision detection and this has simplified the simulation. Also, I added GUI controls to change the parameters in real-time. This allows easy fine-tuning & exploration, hence, I was able to find some never-seen-before patterns emerge form some extremely simple models of relations. 
<br> 
The code here is probably an order of magnitude simpler than any other Artificial Life codes out there because I started this solely as an educational material for non-programmers and the general audience.<br>
